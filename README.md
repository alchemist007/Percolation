# Percolation

## Brief Description

This is an assignment from Coursera's Algorithm class taught by Kevin Wayne Robert Sedgewick.
The Percolation class models an abstract process called percolation. 
Percolation models natural phenomenon such as:
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials,
what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor.

Percolation can be represented as a dynamic connectivity problem. Here its solved using
Weighted QuickUnion approach.
